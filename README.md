# quizzing-frontend

This is frontend for the same backend (https://github.com/Pranav-1100/quizzing) I uploaded, to experience my project just clone both the repos and then to run the backend get refer to this repo Readme.md (https://github.com/Pranav-1100/quizzing) and for frontend after cloning just run these commands, First run the backend repo and then use these commands,


``` npm install ```


``` npm run dev ```

After that just go to localhost it is running on (you can refer to your terminal to know about the localhost it is running on to) and experience it :D.
